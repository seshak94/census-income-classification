# Census Income Classification

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a person earns above or below $50K based on U.S. Census demographic and employment features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and encoded census data: handled missing values, label encoding, and binning
- Performed EDA to analyze income distribution across variables like education, occupation, and race
- Trained multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Run census_income_classifier.ipynb.
